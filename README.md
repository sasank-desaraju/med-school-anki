# med-school-anki
Markdown files for medical school that can turn into Anki cards


# How To Use:

## Where Files Should Live:

### Your personal md2anki config directory:

- Your config file which you will edit - made for you as `md2anki.config.ini`
- Your placeholder markdown file - make an empty markdown file yourself and link to it in your config
    - e.g. `input md file path = /path/to/my/md2anki/config/placeholder.md`
- Everything else that md2anki creates for you

### This repository

- Markdown files of Anki cards in the appropriate folder (e.g. Genetics/Week_1/DNA.md)
- Images used in the markdown files in one giant pile in the /img directory
    - Please use .gif format since these files tend to be smaller (better compression)
    - Since the images will be in one giant piles, please name the image files descriptively when you add them
    - let us use lowercase, hyphenated syntax AKA [Kebab Case](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference/) (e.g. dna-double-helix.gif)
